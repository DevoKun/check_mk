* Package pnp4nagios?

  The require or recommend it 

* check-mk-agent: add debconf question as to whether to use caching agent
  (Then mangle xinetd.conf appropriately.)

* multisite: need to insert configuration line in nagios.cfg

  broker_module=/usr/lib/check_mk/livestatus.o /var/lib/nagios3/rw/live

* Deal with lintian messages

  W: check-mk-livestatus: binary-without-manpage usr/bin/unixcat
  W: check-mk-agent: binary-without-manpage usr/bin/check_mk_agent
  W: check-mk-agent: binary-without-manpage usr/bin/check_mk_caching_agent
  W: check-mk-agent: binary-without-manpage usr/bin/waitmax

* The data in /usr/share/doc/check-mk/checks/ should probably be elsewhere

  Though I'm unsure about that.   Maybe it's fine.

* Move logwatch state file out of /etc (into /var/state or maybe /var/lib)
  (/etc/... should all be manually editable stuff)

* Figure out where to put stuff in htdocs.tar.gz
  
  This provides the logwatch viewing/cleanup functionality via
  logwatch.php.

  The same functionality is provided by multisite (if installed)
  via the URL /check_mk/logwatch.py, which is what everything seems
  configured to use.

  For now, don't even package the htdocs stuff.   If needed, it
  should probably be in its own package (which would conflict with
  multisite.)
